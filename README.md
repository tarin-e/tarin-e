Hi, Iâ€™m Tarin! I'm a data science master's student at The University of Auckland. I have 2+ years of experience in mechatronics engineering, including working on Python and C++ in a production environment.

Join me in advancing my data science, statistical and computer science skills!

Currently working on... 
- Flight Delay Prediction based on Spatial-Temporal Weather Data
- Methane Detection using Satellite Data
- Gravitational Wave Astronomy (haven't started yet tbh)

Keen to collaborate on...
- Anything fun, exciting and not traumatic
