Hi, Iâ€™m Tarin! I'm a data science student at The University of Auckland. I have 2+ years of experience in mechatronics engineering, including working on Python and C++ in a production environment.

Come join me on my journey of advancing my skills in statistical learning, regression and machine learning!

Currently working on... 
- Data science projects for my learning

Keen to collaborate on...
- Any computer vision projects which require some sort of machine learning
- Other Kaggle competitions!
- Anything really cool and exciting. Please reach out if you have any ideas!
