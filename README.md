Hi, I'm Tarin! I'm a data science master's student at The University of Auckland. I have 2+ years of experience in mechatronics engineering, including working on Python and C++ in a production environment.

Join me in advancing my data science, statistical and computer science skills!

Currently working on... 
- :flight_departure: Flight Delay Prediction based on Spatial-Temporal Weather Data
- :earth_asia: Methane Detection with Satellite Data
- :milky_way: Gravitational Wave Astronomy (haven't started yet tbh)

Keen to collaborate on...
- Anything fun, exciting and not traumatic
